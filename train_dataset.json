Business.\nOur Mission\nImprove people\u2019s lives with \nthe world\u2019s best transportation.Overview\nLyft,\n Inc  (the  \u201cCompany\u201d  or  \u201cLyft\u201d)  started  a  movement  to  revolutionize  transportation.  In  2012,  we  launched  our  peer-to-peer  marketplace  for  on-demandridesharing\n and have continued to pioneer innovations aligned with our mission. Today, Lyft is one of the largest multimodal transportation networks in the United Statesand Canada.\nWe\n believe that the world is at the beginning of a shift away from car ownership to Transportation-as-a-Service (\u201cTaaS\u201d). Lyft is at the forefront of this massivesocietal\n change. Our ridesharing marketplace connects drivers with riders via the Lyft mobile application (the \u201cLyft App\u201d) in cities across the United States and in selectcities\n in Canada. We believe that our ridesharing marketplace allows riders to use their cars less and offers a viable alternative to car ownership while providing driversusing\n our platform the freedom and independence to choose when, where, how long and on what platforms they work. As this evolution continues, we believe there is amassive opportunity for us to i\nmprove the lives of riders by connecting them to more affordable and convenient transportation options.We\n are laser-focused on revolutionizing transportation. We have established a scaled network of users brought together by our robust technology platform (the\u201cLyft\n Platform\u201d)  that  powers  rides  and  connections  every  day.  We  leverage  our  technology  platform,  the  scale  and  density  of  our  user  network  and  insights  from  asignificant\n number of rides to continuously improve our ridesharing marketplace efficiency and develop new offerings. We\u2019ve also taken steps to ensure our network iswell positioned to benefit \nfrom technological innovation in mobility.Today,\n our offerings include an expanded set of transportation modes in select cities, such as access to a network of shared bikes and scooters (\u201cLight Vehicles\u201d)for\n shorter rides and first-mile and last-mile legs of multimodal trips, information about nearby public transit routes, and Lyft Rentals, an offering for renters who want torent a car for a fix\ned period of time for personal use. We believe our transportation network offers a viable alternative to car ownership.We\n generate substantially all of our revenue from our ridesharing marketplace that connects drivers and riders. We collect service fees and commissions fromdrivers\n for their use of our ridesharing marketplace. As drivers accept more rider leads and complete more rides, we earn more revenue. We also generate revenue fromriders\n renting  Light  Vehicles,  drivers  renting  vehicles  through  Express  Drive,  Lyft  Rentals  renters,  Lyft  Driver  Center  and  Lyft  Auto  Care  users,  and  by  making  ourridesharing\n marketplace available to organizations through our Lyft Business offerings, such as our Concierge and Corporate Business Travel programs. In the secondquarter of 2021, we began genera\nting revenues from licensing and data access agreements, primarily with third-party autonomous vehicle companies.We\n have made focused and substantial  investments  in support of our mission. For example,  to continually  launch new innovations on our platform,  we haveinvested\n heavily in research and development and have completed multiple strategic acquisitions. We have also invested in sales and marketing to grow our community,cultivate a diffe\nrentiated brand that resonates with drivers and riders and promote further brand awareness. Together, these investments have enabled us to create a powerfulmultimodal platfor\nm and scaled user network.Notwithstanding\n the impact of COVID-19, we are continuing to invest in the future, both organically and through acquisitions of complementary businesses. Wealso\n continue to invest in the expansion of our network of Light Vehicles and Lyft Autonomous, which focuses on the deployment and scaling of third-party self-drivingtechnology\n on the Lyft network. Our strategy is to always be at the forefront of transportation innovation, and we believe that through these investments, we will continueto be well positioned as a le\nader in TaaS. Even as we invest in the business, we also remain focused on finding ways to operate more efficiently.To advance our mission, we aim\n to build the defining brand of our generation and to advocate through our commitment to social and environmental responsibility.We\n believe  that  our  brand  represents  freedom  at  your  fingertips:  freedom  from  the  stresses  of  car  ownership  and  freedom  to  do  and  see  more.",

        "4478f0d8-cf03-44bc-bad8-1574b64925db": "Impact of COVID-19 to our BusinessThe\n ongoing  COVID-19  pandemic  continues  to  impact  communities  in  the  United  States,  Canada  and  globally.  Since  the  pandemic  began  in  March  2020,governments\n and  private  businesses  -  at  the  recommendation  of  public  health  officials  -  have  enacted  precautions  to  mitigate  the  spread  of  the  virus,  including  travelrestrictions\n and  social  distancing  measures  in  many  regions  of  the  United  States  and  Canada,  and  many  enterprises  have  instituted  and  maintained  work  from  homeprograms and limited\n the number of employees on site. Beginning in the middle of March 2020, the pandemic and these related responses caused decreased demand for ourplatform\n leading to decreased revenues as well as decreased earning opportunities for drivers on our platform. Our business continues to be impacted by the COVID-19pandemic.\nAlthough\n we have seen some signs of demand improving, particularly compared to the demand levels at the start of the pandemic, demand levels continue to beaffected by the\n impact of variants and changes in case counts. The exact timing and pace of the recovery remain uncertain. The extent to which our operations will continueto\n be impacted by the pandemic will depend largely on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including new informationwhich\n may emerge concerning COVID-19 variants and the severity of the pandemic and actions by government authorities and private businesses to contain the pandemicor\n recover from its impact, among other things. For example, an increase in cases due to variants of the virus has caused many businesses to delay employees returning tothe\n office,  which  in  turn  reduces  levels  of  demand.  Even  as  travel  restrictions  and  shelter-in-place  orders  are  modified  or  lifted,  we  anticipate  that  continued  socialdistancing, altered consu\nmer behavior, reduced travel and commuting, and expected corporate cost cutting will be significant challenges for us. The strength and duration ofthese challenges cannot b\ne presently estimated.In\n response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have adopted multiple measures, including, but not limited, to establishing new health and safety requirements forridesharing\n and  updating  workplace  policies.  We  also  made  adjustments  to  our  expenses  and  cash  flow  to  correlate  with  declines  in  revenues  including  headcountreductions in 2020.\nFor\n more information on risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and our litigation matters, see the section titled \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in Item 1A of Part I.

Our key growth strategies include our plans to:\u2022\nIncrease Rider Use Cases. We  are continuously working to make Lyft the transportation network of choice across an expanding range of use cases. We offerproducts to\n simplify travel decision-making, for example with our Lyft Pink subscription plan, Lyft Pass commuter programs, first-mile and last-mile services anduniversity\n safe rides programs. We also provide centralized tools and enterprise transportation solutions, such as our Concierge offering, that enable organizationsto manage the transport\nation needs of customers, employees and other constituents.\u2022\nGrow Active Riders. We  see opportunities to continue to recoup and grow our rider base amid the continuing COVID-19 pandemic. We may make incrementalinvestments in our\n brand and in growth marketing to maintain and drive increasing consumer preference for Lyft. We may also offer discounts for first-time ridersto\n try Lyft or provide incentives to existing riders to encourage increased ride frequency. We plan to continue to add density to our ridesharing marketplace byattracting\n and retaining more drivers on our network to deliver the best possible service levels. Additionally, we will continue to evaluate ways to expand ournetwork\n coverage  beyond  the  geographies  and  markets  we  currently  serve.  We  also  believe  we  are  a  beneficiary  of  demographic  shifts,  such  as  the  growingpercentage of the U.S. population \nthat is accustomed to on-demand services and has digital-first preferences.\u2022\nGrow Our Share of Consumers\u2019 Transportation Spend.

Our employee gender and ethnicity information is basedon\n self-identification,  and  employees  who  did  not  disclose  their  gender  or  ethnicity  have  been  excluded  from  the  applicable  disclosure.  As  of  December  31,  2021,employees\n who did not disclose gender represented approximately 2% of total employees, and employees who did not disclose ethnicity represented approximately 2% oftotal U.S. employees.\nWe\n strive to build a more representative workforce which requires an intentional and comprehensive effort to reach and recruit outstanding candidates, developtalent\n internally, and open up pathways for advancement.

Our vision is to rebuildcities\n around people by offering seamless access through the Lyft App to on-demand rides, public transit, and car rentals as well as lower-carbon micromobility modes. Asanother\n step in the shift from personal car ownership, we\u2019ve also launched Lyft Pink, our premier membership program, which offers discounted pricing for rideshare,bikes, and scooters, in addition \nto perks for car rentals.We\n launched our national Resilient Streets Initiative in September 2020 and offered a vision for how cities can safely and efficiently move the greatest number ofpeople\n as economic, educational and social activities resume in our cities. The initiative reimagined what a \u201cresilient street corridor\u201d might look like in cities where Lyftoperates\n micromobility  services.

LyftUp programs included:\u2022\nJobs Access - provides rides to and from job interviews, job trainings and/or the first few weeks of a new job;\u2022\nGrocery Access - provides rides to and from the grocery store for families living in certain areas without sufficient grocery store access;\u2022\nCommunity Grants Program - awards ride credits to hyp erlocal nonprofit organizations across the country making a difference in their communities;\u2022\nMicromobility  Access -  provides  deeply  discounted  bikeshare  and  scooter-share  memberships  for  eligible  applicants  who  qualify  for  federal,  state  or  localassistance programs;\n\u2022\nUniversal Vaccine Access Campaign -  mobilizes a coalition of partners to provide rides to and from COVID-19 vaccination sites for low-income, underinsuredand at-risk communities;\n\u2022\nDisaster Response - provides rides to access v ital services both leading up to and in the wake of disasters and other local emergencies when roads are safe to do so;and\n\u2022\nVoting Access - provides rides to the polls du ring Federal elections, with a focus on supporting individuals who traditionally face barriers to voting, such asseniors, veterans and commun\nities of color.In\n response to the passage of Texas Senate Bill 8 (\u201cSB8\u201d) which raised concerns that drivers could be sued simply for transporting passengers, Lyft created aDriver\n Legal Defense Fund to cover 100% of legal fees for drivers sued under SB8 while driving on our platform. We also donated $1 million to Planned Parenthood tohelp ensure\n that transportation is never a barrier to healthcare access. Drivers using Lyft are never responsible for monitoring where their riders go or why. Similarly, ridersshould never have to justify or sh\nare where they are going or why.Corporate Governance\nOur\n board of directors regularly evaluates our corporate governance structure and processes to help steer the company's direction and ensure it is operating withthe\n utmost business integrity. More information about our directors, executive officers and corporate governance will be included in our definitive Proxy Statement for our2022 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.\nCorporate Information\nWe\n were incorporated in 2007 as Bounder Web, Inc., a Delaware corporation. In 2008, we changed our name to Zimride, Inc. We founded Lyft in 2012 andchanged our name to Lyft, Inc. \nin 2013 when we sold the assets related to our Zimride operations.13",

Weare\n unable to predict the extent to which the pandemic and related effects will continue to adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operationsand the achievement of our strategic obj\nectives.Our\n business, operations and financial performance have been negatively impacted by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and related public health responses, suchas\n travel bans, travel restrictions and shelter-in-place orders. The pandemic and these related responses continue to evolve and have caused, and are expected to continue tocause,\n decreased  demand  for  our  platform  relative  to pre-COVID-19  demand,  disruptions  in  global  supply chains,  and  significant  volatility  and disruption  of  financialmarkets.\nThe\n COVID-19 pandemic has subjected our operations, financial performance and financial condition to a number of risks, including, but not limited to, thosediscussed below:\n\u2022\nDeclines in travel as a result of COVID-19, including commuting, local travel, and business and leisure travel, have resulted in decreased demand for our platformwhich\n has decreased our revenues. These factors have in the past and may continue to lead to a decrease in earning opportunities for drivers on our platform. Wepaused our\n shared rides offerings as a result of COVID-19, but relaunched our shared rides offerings in select markets beginning in July 2021. While certain typesof\n travel  have  begun  to  increase  compared  to  earlier  periods  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  overall  levels  remain  depressed  and  changes  in  travel  trends  andbehavior\n arising from COVID-19, including as a result of new strains of COVID-19, may continue to develop or persist over time and further contribute to thisadverse effect.\n\u2022\nChanges in driver behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic have led to reduced levels of driver availability on our platform relative to rider demand in certainmarkets.\n This imbalance fluctuates for various reasons, and to the extent that driver availability is limited, our service levels have been and may be negativelyimpacted\n and we have increased prices or provided additional incentives and may need to continue to do so, which may adversely affect our business, financialcondition and results of oper\nation.\u2022\nThe responsive measures to the COVID-19 pandemic have caused us to modify our business practices by permitting corporate employees in nearly all of ourlocations\n to  work  remotely,  limiting  employee  travel,  and  canceling,  postponing  or  holding  virtual  events  and  meetings.  We  may  be  required  to  or  choosevoluntarily\n to take additional actions for the health and safety of our workforce and users of our platform, including after the pandemic subsides and with respectto\n vaccination, whether in response to government orders or based on our own determinations of what is in the best interests of our employees or users of ourplatform.\n The effects of the pandemic, including permanent hybrid and remote working arrangements for employees, may also impact our real estate footprint,financial reporting\n systems and internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and may increase the risk of a cybersecurity breach or incident. Tothe\n extent these measures result in decreased productivity, harm our company culture, adversely affect our ability to timely and accurately report our financialstatements or maint\nain internal controls, or otherwise negatively affect our business, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\u2022\nWe design and contract to manufacture Light Vehicles using a limited number of external suppliers, and a continuous, stable and cost-effective supply of LightVehicles\n that meet our standards is critical to our operations.

Further, COVID-19 has and may continue to negatively impact Lyft\u2019s ability to conduct rental operationsthrough\n the Express Drive program and Lyft Rentals as a result of restrictions on travel, mandated closures, limited staffing availability, and other factors relatedto\n COVID-19. For example, in 2020, Lyft Rentals temporarily ceased operations, closing its rental locations, as a result of COVID-19. Further, while ExpressDrive\n rental periods renew on a weekly basis, new rental reservations were temporarily blocked in 2020, and subsequently re-opened with modified operations tolimit\n the proximity and amount of interactions between associates and drivers, and to address additional cleaning which may be required as a result of COVID-19.These\n operations are more costly, and vulnerable to shortages of cleaning supplies or other materials required to operate rental sites while minimizing the risk ofexposure\n to COVID-19. As a result of the adverse impact to demand for rides on the rideshare platform, drivers renting through the Express Drive program havehad\n and may continue to have a diminished ability to pay their rental fees. In response, in 2020, Flexdrive temporarily reduced pricing for Flexdrive rentals incities\n most affected by COVID-19, which has since been reversed. In 2020, Flexdrive also began to waive rental fees for drivers who are confirmed to have testedpositive\n for COVID-19 or requested to quarantine by a medical professional, which it continues to do at this time.

Further, because we have an evolving financial model andoperate\n in a rapidly evolving market, any predictions about our future revenue and expenses may not be as accurate as they would be if we had a static financial model oroperated\n in  a  more  predictable  market.  We  have  encountered  in  the  past,  and  will  encounter  in  the  future,  risks  and  uncertainties  frequently  experienced  by  growingcompanies\n with limited operating histories in rapidly changing industries. If our assumptions regarding these risks and uncertainties, which we use to plan and operate ourbusiness,\n are incorrect or change, or if we do not address these risks successfully, our results of operations could differ materially from our expectations and our business,financial condition and \nresults of operations could be adversely affected.Our financial performance in recent periods may not b\ne indicative of future performance, and we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability in the future.Prior\n to COVID-19, we grew rapidly. In 2020, due to COVID-19 and the related government and public health measures, our revenue declined significantly andwe\n have since recovered partially, but our revenue remains below pre-COVID levels and the timeline for a full recovery is uncertain. Accordingly, our recent revenuegrowth\n rate and financial performance, including prior to the effects of COVID-19, the decline related to COVID-19 and recent growth rates compared to periods in themidst\n of the COVID-19 pandemic, should not be considered indicative of our future performance. Further, although we have achieved Adjusted EBITDA profitability ineach\n of the last three quarters, we have incurred net losses each year since our inception and we can provide no assurances that we will achieve or maintain AdjustedEBITDA profitability in the futu\nre, on a quarterly or annual basis, or that we will ever achieve profitability on a GAAP basis.19",

These  efforts  may  be  more  costly  than  we  expect  and  may  not  result  inincreased\n revenue  or  growth  in  our  business.  For  example,  we  have  incurred  and  will  continue  to  incur  additional  costs  and  expenses  associated  with  the  passage  ofProposition 22 in California including provi\nding drivers in California with new earnings opportunities and protections, including contributions towards healthcare coverage,occupational\n accident insurance and minimum guaranteed earnings, and we have incurred and expect to continue to incur additional costs and expenses associated with theCOVID-19\n pandemic, including sales, marketing and costs relating to our efforts to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, we have expanded overtime\n to include more asset-intensive offerings such as our network of Light Vehicles, Flexdrive, Lyft Rentals and Lyft Auto Care. We are also expanding the supportavailable\n to drivers at our Driver Hubs, our driver-centric service centers and community spaces, Driver Centers, our vehicle service centers, Mobile Services, Lyft AutoCare,\n and through our Express Drive vehicle rental  program. In addition, we have established  environmental  programs, such as our commitment  to 100% EVs on ourplatform\n by the end of 2030. These offerings and programs require significant capital investments and recurring costs, including debt payments, maintenance, depreciation,asset\n life and asset replacement costs, and if we are not able to maintain sufficient levels of utilization of such assets or such offerings are otherwise not successful, ourinvestments\n may not generate sufficient returns and our financial condition may be adversely affected. In addition to the above, a determination in, or settlement of, anylegal proceeding that classifies a\n driver on a ridesharing platform as an employee may require us to significantly alter our existing business model and operations (includingpotentially\n suspending or ceasing operations in impacted jurisdictions), increase our costs and impact our ability to add qualified drivers to our platform and grow ourbusiness,\n which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and our ability to achieve or maintain profitability in the future.Additionally,\n stock-based  compensation  expense  related  to  restricted  stock  units  (\u201cRSUs\u201d)  and  other  equity  awards  may  continue  to  be  a  significant  expense  in  futureperiods,\n and as of December 31, 2021, we had $587.5 million of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to RSUs, net of estimated forfeitures, that will berecognized\n over  a  weighted-average  period  of  approximately  1.7  years.

To  attract  and  retain  qualified  drivers,  we  have,  among  other  things,  offered  sign-up  and  referral  bonuses  andprovided\n access to third-party vehicle rental programs for drivers who do not have or do not wish to use their own vehicle.

For example,during\n the pandemic, we have periodically had a shortage of available drivers relative to rider demand in certain markets particularly where restrictions on social activitiesand\n visiting business venues were or have been eased. This imbalance fluctuates for various reasons, and to the extent that driver availability remains limited and we offerincreased\n incentives to improve supply, our revenue may be negatively impacted. Additionally, following the passage of Proposition 22 in California, drivers have beenable\n to access the earning opportunities described in the ballot measure. Our competitors may attempt to compete for drivers on the basis of these earning opportunities, ordrivers\n may determine that such earning opportunities are not sufficient. Further, other jurisdictions may adopt similar laws and regulations, which would likely increaseour\n expenses.  Notwithstanding  the  passage  of  Proposition  22,  ongoing  litigation  seeking  to  reclassify  drivers  as  employees  is  pending  in  multiple  jurisdictions.

If such litigation is successful in one or more jurisdictions, we maybe\n required  to  classify  drivers  as  employees  rather  than  independent  contractors  in  those  jurisdictions.

Certain of our competitors offer, or may in the future offer, lower-priced or a broader rangeof\n offerings. Similarly, certain competitors may use marketing strategies that enable them to attract or retain qualified drivers and riders at a lower cost than we do. Thisincludes\n the use of pricing algorithms to set dynamic prices depending on the route, time of day and pick-up and drop-off locations of riders. From time to time, we havemade\n pricing changes and spent significant amounts on marketing and both rider and driver incentives, and we expect that, from time to time, we will be required, throughcompetition,\n regulation or otherwise, to reduce the price of rides for riders, increase the incentives we pay to drivers on our platform or reduce the fees we charge thedrivers\n on our platform, or to increase our marketing and other expenses to attract and retain qualified drivers and riders in response to competitive pressures. Furthermore,the economic sensitivity of drivers and riders\n on our platform may vary by geographic location, and as we expand, our pricing methodologies may not enable us to competeeffectively\n in these locations. Local regulations may affect our pricing in certain geographic locations, which could amplify these effects. For example, state and local lawsand\n regulations  regarding  pricing  related  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic  and  otherwise  have  imposed  limits  on  prices  for  certain  services  and  certain  local  regulationsregarding\n minimum earnings standards for drivers have caused us to revise our pricing methodology in certain markets, including New York City and Seattle.

A\n determination in, or settlement of, any legal proceeding, whether we are party to such legal proceeding or not, that classifies a driver utilizing a ridesharingplatform\n as  an  employee,  may  require  us  to  revise  our  pricing  methodologies  to  account  for  such  a  change  to  driver  classification.  The  passage  of  Proposition  22  inCalifornia has enabled us to provide additional earning opp\nortunities to drivers in California, including guaranteed earnings. The transition has, and will continue to, requireadditional\n costs and we expect to face other challenges as we transition drivers to this new model, including changes to our pricing. We have also tested or launched, andmay in\n the future test or launch, certain changes to the rates and fee structure for drivers on our platform, which may not ultimately be successful in attracting and retainingqualified\n drivers. Moreover, successful  litigation to overturn Proposition 22, or the reclassification  of drivers on our platform  as employees  could reduce the availablesupply\n of drivers as drivers leave the platform due to the changes in flexibility under an employment model. While we do and will attempt to optimize ride prices andbalance\n supply and demand in our ridesharing marketplace, our assessments may not be accurate or there may be errors in the technology used in our pricing and we couldbe underpricing\n or overpricing our offerings.

For example, in 2021, in New York City, a competing operator named Joco attempted to launch a bike share program in violation of Citi Bike\u2019s exclusivity,arguing\n that New York City could not regulate Joco because Joco\u2019s stations were in private garages. The City successfully obtained a preliminary injunction against Joco,with our support. However, Joco\n continues to operate in a limited manner and it is possible Lyft may need to further support the City in additional legal action against Joco.A\n negative determination in other legal disputes regarding bike and scooter sharing, including an adverse determination regarding our existing rights to operate, couldadversely\n affect our competitive position and results of operations. Additionally, we may from time to time be denied permits to operate, or be temporarily restricted fromoperating\n due to public health and safety measures, our bike share program or scooter share program in certain jurisdictions. For example, the City of Miami suspendedrentals\n of bikes and scooters from March through October 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic  and again suspended rentals  of scooters from December  2020through February 2021 an\nd for a brief period in November 2021 due to concerns with certain aspects of the program.

If any of our third-party vehicle rental partners or third-party vehicle supply, fleet management and finance partners terminates itsrelationship\n with  us  or  refuses  to  renew  its  agreement  with  us  on  commercially  reasonable  terms,  the  availability  of  vehicles  for  drivers  in  certain  markets  could  beadversely\n impacted, and we may need to find an alternate provider, and may not be able to secure similar terms or replace such partners in an acceptable time frame.Similarly,\n in the event that vehicle manufacturers issue recalls that affect the usage or the supply of vehicles or automotive parts is interrupted, including as a result ofpublic\n health  crises,  such  as  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  affecting  vehicles  in  these  partners\u2019  fleets,  the  supply  of  vehicles  available  from  these  partners  could  becomeconstrained. For example, in September 2019, GM issued a recall\n affecting the 2018 Chevy Malibu, which affected a moderate portion of the fleet provided by Lyft\u2019s rentalpartners.\n In addition, in May 2020, Hertz filed for bankruptcy protection, which affected their ability to meet the requirements of our Express Drive program. If we cannotfind\n alternate third-party vehicle rental providers on terms acceptable to us, or these partners\u2019 fleets are impacted by events such as vehicle recalls, we may not be able tomeet\n the driver and consumer demand for rental vehicles, and as a result, our platform may be less attractive to qualified drivers and consumers. In addition, due to anumber\n of factors, including our agreements with our vehicle rental partners and our auto-related insurance program, we incur an incrementally higher insurance cost fromour\n Express  Drive  program  compared  to  the  corresponding  cost  from  the  rest  of  our  ridesharing  marketplace  offerings.

In  addition,  we  have  established  environmental  programs,  such  as  ourcommitment\n to 100% EVs on our platform by the end of 2030, that may limit the range of auto manufacturers or vehicles that we source from or purchase. To the extentthat\n any of these auto manufacturers significantly curtail production, increase the cost of purchasing cars or decline to sell cars to us on terms or at prices consistent withpast agreements,\n despite sourcing vehicles from the used car market and other efforts to mitigate, we may be unable to obtain a sufficient number of vehicles to operate ourExpress Drive or\n Lyft Rentals businesses without significantly increasing fleet costs or reducing volumes. Similarly, where events, such as natural disasters or public healthcrises\n such as the COVID-19 pandemic, make operating rental locations difficult or impossible, or adversely impact rider demand, the demand for or our ability to rentvehicles\n in Lyft Rentals or the Express Drive program has been and could continue to be adversely affected, resulting in reduced utilization of the vehicles in the fleets.Reduced utilization has in\ncreased and could continue to increase costs of maintaining the fleets or storing or moving unused vehicles.The\n costs of the fleet vehicles may also be adversely impacted by the relative strength of the used car market. We currently sell vehicles through auctions, third-party\n resellers and other channels in the used vehicle marketplace. Such channels may not produce stable used vehicle prices. It may be difficult to estimate the residualvalue\n of vehicles used in ridesharing, such as those rented to drivers through our Express Drive program.

If a match between riders is made, our algorithms re-route the driver to include the pick-up location of the matched rider on the active route.For\n Shared and Shared Saver Rides, drivers earn a fixed amount based on a number of factors, including the time and distance of the ride, the base fare charged to ridersand the\n level of rider demand. We determine the rider fare based on the predicted time and distance of the ride, the level of rider demand and the likelihood of being able tomatch additional riders along the given route, and s\nuch fare is quoted to the riders prior to their commitment to the ride. The fare charged to the riders is decoupled from thepayment made to the driver as we do\n not adjust the driver payment based on the success or failure of a match. Accordingly, if the discounted fare quoted and charged to ourShared\n or Shared Saver Rides riders is less than the fixed amount that drivers earn or if our algorithms are unable to consistently match Shared or Shared Saver Ridesriders, then our business, finan\ncial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.If we fail to effecti\nvely manage our up-front pricing methodology, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.With\n the adoption of our up-front pricing methodology, we quote a price to riders of our ridesharing offering before they request a ride. We earn platform andservice fees\n from drivers either as the difference between an amount paid by a rider, which is generally based on an up-front quoted fare, and the amount earned by a driverbased\n on the actual time and distance for the trip or as a fixed percentage of the fare charged to the rider, in each case, less any applicable driver bonuses or incentives andany pass-through amounts pai\nd to drivers and third parties. As we do not control the driver\u2019s actions at any point in the transaction to limit the time and distance for the trip,we\n take on risks related to the driver\u2019s actions which may not be fully mitigated. We may incur a loss from a transaction where an up-front quoted fare paid by a rider isless\n than  the  amount  we  committed  to  pay  a  driver.

From timeto time third parties may\n assert, and in the past have asserted, claims of infringement of intellectual property rights against us. See the section titled \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d foradditional\n information about these types of legal proceedings. In addition, third parties have sent us correspondence regarding various allegations of intellectual propertyinfringement and,\n in some instances, have initiated licensing discussions.

Our competitors and others may now and in the future havesignificantly larger and more mature patent\n portfolios than us. In addition, we have faced, and may again in the future face, litigation involving patent holding companies orother adverse\n patent owners who have no relevant product or service revenue and against whom our own patents may therefore provide little or no deterrence or protection.Many\n potential  litigants,  including  some  of  our  competitors  and  patent-holding  companies,  have  the  ability  to  dedicate  substantial  resources  to  assert  their  intellectualproperty\n rights.

These laws, rules and regulations evolve frequently and their scope may continuallychange, through new legislation, \namendments to existing legislation and changes in enforcement, and may be inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another. For example, theCPRA\n will require new disclosures to California consumers and affords such consumers new data rights and abilities to opt-out of certain sharing of personal information.The\n CPRA provides for fines of up to $7,500 per violation, which can be applied on a per-consumer basis. Aspects of the CPRA and its interpretation and enforcementremain\n unclear. The effects of this legislation potentially are far-reaching, however, and may require us to further modify our data processing practices and policies andincur additional compl\niance-related costs and expenses.

For example, a determination that classifies a driver of a ridesharing platform as an employee, whether we are partyto such determination or no\nt, could cause us to incur significant expenses or require substantial changes to our business model.In\n addition, we regularly include arbitration  provisions in our Terms of Service with the drivers and riders on our platform.  These provisions are intended tostreamline\n the litigation process for all parties involved, as arbitration can in some cases be faster and less costly than litigating disputes in state or federal court. However,arbitration\n may become more costly for us or the volume of arbitration may increase and become burdensome, and the use of arbitration provisions may subject us tocertain\n risks to our reputation and brand, as these provisions have been the subject of increasing public scrutiny. In order to minimize these risks to our reputation andbrand,\n we have in the past and may continue to limit our use of arbitration provisions or be required to do so in a legal or regulatory proceeding, either of which couldincrease our litiga\ntion costs and exposure. For example, effective May 2018, we ended mandatory arbitration of sexual misconduct claims by users and employees.Further,\n with the potential for conflicting rules regarding the scope and enforceability of arbitration on a state-by-state basis, as well as between state and federallaw,\n there is a risk that some or all of our arbitration provisions could be subject to challenge or may need to be revised to exempt certain categories of protection. If ourarbitration agreements were found to be\n unenforceable, in whole or in part, or specific claims are required to be exempted from arbitration, we could experience an increasein\n our costs to litigate disputes and the time involved in resolving such disputes, and we could face increased exposure to potentially costly lawsuits, each of which couldadversely affect our bus\niness, financial condition and results of operations.As\n we expand our platform offerings, we may become subject to additional laws and regulations, and any actual or perceived failure by us to comply with such lawsand\n regulations  or  manage  the  increased  costs  associated  with  such  laws  and  regulations  could  adversely  affect  our  business,  financial  condition  and  results  ofoperations.\nAs\n we continue to expand our platform offerings and user base, we may become subject to additional laws and regulations, which may differ or conflict from onejurisdiction\n to another.

Our business may not generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service ourdebt\n and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets,restructuring\n debt or obtaining additional debt financing or equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive.

In addition, any of our future debt agreements may contain restrictive covenants thatmay\n prohibit us from adopting any of these alternatives. Our failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, couldresult in the accel\neration of our debt.In\n addition,  our  indebtedness,  combined  with  our  other  financial  obligations  and  contractual  commitments,  could  have  other  important  consequences.

For example, certain index providers have announced restrictions on including companies with multiple-class share structures in certain oftheir\n indexes. In July 2017, FTSE Russell and S&P Dow Jones announced that they would cease to allow most newly public companies utilizing dual or multi-class capitalstructures\n to be included in their indices. Affected indices include the Russell 2000 and the S&P 500, S&P MidCap 400 and S&P SmallCap 600, which together make upthe\n S&P Composite 1500. Beginning in 2017, MSCI, a leading stock index provider, opened public consultations on their treatment of no-vote and multi-class structuresand\n temporarily  barred  new  multi-class  listings  from  certain  of its  indices;  however,  in October  2018, MSCI announced  its  decision  to  include  equity  securities  \u201cwithunequal\n voting structures\u201d in its indices and to launch a new index that specifically includes voting rights in its eligibility criteria. Under the announced policies, our dualclass capital\n structure makes us ineligible for inclusion in certain indices, and as a result, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds and other investment vehicles that attempt topassively\n track those indices will not be investing in our stock. These policies are still fairly new and it is as of yet unclear what effect, if any, they will have on thevaluations\n of publicly traded companies excluded from the indices, but it is possible that they may depress these valuations compared to those of other similar companiesthat\n are included. Because of our dual class structure, we will likely be excluded from certain of these indexes and we cannot assure you that other stock indexes will nottake\n similar actions. Given the sustained flow of investment funds into passive strategies that seek to track certain indexes, exclusion from stock indexes would likelypreclude\n investment by many of these funds and could make our Class A common stock less attractive to other investors.

Since  the  pandemic  began  in  March  2020,governments\n and  private  businesses  -  at  the  recommendation  of  public  health  officials  -  have  enacted  precautions  to  mitigate  the  spread  of  the  virus,  including  travelrestrictions\n and  social  distancing  measures  in  many  regions  of  the  United  States  and  Canada,  and  many  enterprises  have  instituted  and  maintained  work  from  homeprograms and limited\n the number of employees on site. Beginning in the middle of March 2020, the pandemic and these related responses caused decreased demand for ourplatform\n leading to decreased revenues as well as decreased earning opportunities for drivers on our platform. Our business continues to be impacted by the COVID-19pandemic.\nAlthough\n we have seen some signs of demand improving as COVID-19 case counts trended down, particularly compared to the demand levels at the start of thepandemic,\n demand levels continue to be affected by the impact of variants and changes in case counts. The exact timing and pace of the recovery remain uncertain. Theextent\n to  which  our  operations  will  continue  to  be  impacted  by  the  pandemic  will  depend  largely  on  future  developments,  which  are  highly  uncertain  and  cannot  beaccurately predicted,\n including new information which may emerge concerning COVID-19 variants and the severity of the pandemic and actions by government authoritiesand\n private businesses to contain the pandemic or recover from its impact, among other things. For example, an increase in cases due to variants of the virus has causedmany\n businesses to delay employees returning to the office.",

Even as travel restrictions and shelter-in-place orders are modified or lifted, we anticipate that continued socialdistancing, altered consu\nmer behavior, reduced travel and commuting, and expected corporate cost cutting will be significant challenges for us. The strength and duration ofthese challenges cannot b\ne presently estimated.In\n response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have adopted multiple measures, including, but not limited, to establishing new health and safety requirements forridesharing\n and  updating  workplace  policies.  We  also  made  adjustments  to  our  expenses  and  cash  flow  to  correlate  with  declines  in  revenues  including  headcountreductions in 2020.\n56",

In 2021, we saw continuedrecovery\n as vaccines were more widely distributed and more communities fully reopened, which resulted in revenue increasing 36% in 2021 compared to the prior year,and\n the number of Active Riders increasing 49.2% in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. Net loss decreased $743.5 million, or 42%, from$1.8\n billion in 2020 to $1.0 billion in 2021, which included a benefit from a pre-tax gain of $119.3 million from the transaction with Woven Planet. Adjusted EBITDA in2021\n was  $92.9  million,  marking  our  first  annual  Adjusted  EBITDA  profitability.  We  remain  focused  on  our  long-term  growth  opportunities.

We will receive, in total, approximately $515 million in cash in connection with thistransaction, with $165 mill\nion paid upfront and $350 million to be paid over a five-year period.The\n divestiture did not represent a strategic shift with a major effect on our operations and financial results, and therefore does not qualify for reporting as adiscontinued\n operation. We recognized a pre-tax gain of $119.3 million as a result of our transaction with Woven Planet, which was included in other income, net on theconsolidated\n statement of operations for the quarter ended September 30, 2021.

(\u201cPVIC\u201d), entered into a Quota Share Reinsurance Agreement (the\u201cReinsurance\n Agreement\u201d) with DARAG Bermuda LTD (\u201cDARAG\u201d), under which DARAG reinsured a legacy portfolio of auto insurance policies, based on reserves inplace\n as of March 31, 2021, for $183.2 million of coverage above the liabilities recorded as of that date. Under the terms of the Reinsurance Agreement, PVIC ceded toDARAG\n approximately $251.3 million of certain legacy insurance liabilities for policies underwritten during the period of October 1, 2018 to October 1, 2020, with anaggregate\n limit of $434.5 million, for a premium of $271.5 million (\u201cthe Reinsurance Transaction\u201d). The Reinsurance Agreement arrangement does not discharge PVIC ofits\n obligations to the policyholder. A loss of approximately $20.4 million for the net cost of the Reinsurance Transaction was recognized on the consolidated statement ofoperations for the nine mon\nths ended September 30, 2021, with $20.2 million in cost of revenue and $0.2 million in general and administrative expenses.Active Riders and Revenue per Active Rider\nThe\n COVID-19  pandemic  caused  a  significant  decrease  in  Active  Riders  and  in  revenue  per  Active  Rider  beginning  March  2020.

An Active Rider is identified bya\n unique phone number. If a rider has two mobile phone numbers or changed their phone number and such rider took rides using both phone numbers during the quarter,that person would count\n as two Active Riders. If a rider has a personal and business profile tied to the same mobile phone number, that person would be considered a singleActive Rider. If a ride has been requested by an\n organization using our Concierge offering for the benefit of a rider, we exclude this rider in the calculation of Active Ridersunless the ride is access\nible in the Lyft App. Revenue per Active Rider is calculated by dividing revenue for a period by Active Riders for the same period.Beginning\n in the fourth quarter of 2020, some riders were able to access their Concierge rides in the Lyft App if they already had a Lyft account. Accordingly,Lyft\n updated the definition of Active Riders to include Concierge riders if the rider\u2019s phone number matches that of a verified Lyft account, allowing the rider to accesstheir\n ride in the Lyft App. This update resulted in a 0.01% increase, or an additional 927 Active Riders in the fourth quarter of 2020. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2020, allConcierge riders were exc\nluded from the calculation of Active Riders as Concierge rides could not be matched with verified rider accounts.With\n the exception of the three months ended March 31, 2021 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2020, Active Riders in each of the three monthperiods\n ended  June  30,  September  30,  and  December  31,  2021  increased  compared  to  the  same  period  in  2020  as  vaccines  were  more  widely  distributed  and  morecommunities\n fully reopened. Active Riders in the three months periods ended June 30, September 30, and December 31, 2020 represented significantly lower Active Ridercounts\n since shelter-in-place orders and other travel restrictions were first implemented across North America in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. Theslight decrease in the number of Active Riders in the three months ended \nDecember 31, 2021 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2021 was due primarilyto the increasing COVID-19 case counts \nfrom COVID-19 variants and their impact on demand as well as the seasonality we typically experience in the winter months.Revenue per Active Rider increased in each of the three months period\ns ended March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31, 2021 as compared to the sameperiods\n in  2020,  primarily  reflecting  the  improvement  in  demand  on  our  platform  compared  to  earlier  periods  during  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  which  had  materiallylimited\n people's mobility and severely reduced Active Riders. Revenue per Active Rider reached an all-time high in the three months ended December 31, 2021, increasingcompared\n to the three months ended September 30, 2021. This was driven by an increase in ride frequency as well as a shift toward higher revenue rides such as airportrides,\n reflecting the increased travel experienced in the fourth quarter in 2021 nationwide. Revenue per Active Rider also benefited from revenues from licensing and dataaccess agreements, beg\ninning in the second quarter of 2021.Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur\n consolidated  financial  statements  and  the  related  notes  thereto  included  elsewhere  in  this  Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K  are  prepared  in  accordance  withGAAP.",

We recognize revenue from fees paid by drivers foruse\n of our Lyft Platform offerings in accordance with ASC 606 as described in Note 2 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements. Drivers enter into terms ofservice (\u201cToS\u201d) with us in orde\nr to use our Lyft Driver App.58",
        "07e50c2d-77ac-4eb4-a6db-64238809075d": "We provide a service to drivers to complete a successful transportation service for riders. This service includes on-demand lead generation that assists drivers tofind,\n receive and fulfill on-demand requests from riders seeking transportation services and related collection activities using our Lyft Platform. As a result, our singleperformance obligation in t\nhe transaction is to connect drivers with riders to facilitate the completion of a successful transportation service for riders.We evaluate the presentation of revenue on\n a gross versus net basis based on whether we act as a principal by controlling the transportation service provided to therider\n or whether we act as an agent by arranging for third parties to provide the service to the rider. We facilitate the provision of a transportation service by a driver to arider (the driver\u2019s customer) in order for the driver to fulfill their contractual promise to the rider. The driver fulfills their promise to pro\nvide a transportation service to theircustomer\n through  use  of  the  Lyft  Platform.  While  we  facilitate  setting  the  price  for  transportation  services,  the  drivers  and  riders  have  the  discretion  in  accepting  thetransaction\n price through the platform. We do not control the transportation services being provided to the rider nor do we have inventory risk related to the transportationservices. As a result\n, we act as an agent in facilitating the ability for a driver to provide a transportation service to a rider.We\n report revenue on a net basis, reflecting the service fees and commissions owed to us from the drivers as revenue, and not the gross amount collected from therider.\n We made this determination of not being primarily responsible for the services since we do not promise the transportation services, do not contract with drivers toprovide\n transportation services on our behalf, do not control whether the driver accepts or declines the transportation request via the Lyft Platform, and do not control theprovision of transportation s\nervices by drivers to riders at any point in time either before, during, or after, the trip.We\n consider the ToS and our customary business practices in identifying the contracts under ASC 606. As our customary business practice, a contract existsbetween\n the driver and us when the driver\u2019s ability to cancel the trip lapses, which typically is upon pickup of the rider. We collect the fare and related charges from riderson\n behalf of drivers using the rider\u2019s pre-authorized credit card or other payment mechanism and retain any fees owed to us before making the remaining disbursement todrivers; thus the driver\n\u2019s ability and intent to pay is not subject to significant judgment.We earn\n service fees and commissions from the drivers either as the difference between an amount paid by a rider based on an upfront quoted fare and the amountearned by a driver based on actual time and distance for the trip or as a fixed percentage of the fare charge\nd to the rider. In an upfront quoted fare arrangement, as we do notcontrol\n the driver\u2019s actions at any point in the transaction to limit the time and distance for the trip, we take on risks related to the driver\u2019s actions which may not be fullymitigated. We earn\n a variable amount from the drivers and may record a loss from a transaction, which is recorded as a reduction to revenue, in instances where an up-frontquoted fare offered to \na rider is less than the amount we are committed to pay the driver.We\n recognize  revenue  upon  completion  of  a  ride  as  the  single  performance  obligation  is  satisfied  and  we  have  the  right  to  receive  payment  for  the  servicesrendered upon the complet\nion of the ride.We\n offer various incentive programs to drivers that are recorded as reduction to revenue if we do not receive a distinct good or service in consideration or if wecannot reasonably estim\nate the fair value of goods or services received.In\n some cases, we also earn Concierge platform fees from organizations that use our Concierge offering, which is a product that allows organizations to requestrides\n for their customers and employees through our ridesharing marketplace. Concierge platform fees are earned as a fixed dollar amount per ride or a percentage of theride price depending on the \ncontract and such Concierge platform fee revenue is recognized on a gross basis.We\n recognize revenue from subscription fees paid by users to access transportation options through the Lyft Platform and mobile-based applications over theapplicable subscription p\neriod.We\n generate revenue from licensing and data access agreements. We are primarily responsible for fulfilling our promise to provide rideshare data and access toFlexdrive\n vehicles and bear the fulfillment risk, and the responsibility of providing the data, over the license period.

Under  the  Flexdrive  and  Lyft  Rentals  programs,  weoperate\n a fleet of rental vehicles comprised of both vehicles owned by us and vehicles leased from third-party leasing companies. We either lease or sublease vehicles todrivers\n and Lyft Rentals renters, as a result, we are considered the accounting lessor or sublessor, as applicable, in these arrangements in accordance with ASC 842. Forvehicles\n that are subleased, sublease income and head lease expense for these transactions are recognized on a gross basis on the consolidated financial statements.

        "d70fc0b1-11fe-4ede-89a3-2c85036a9bbf": "Revenue generated from single-use ride fees paid by Light Vehicles riders are recognized upon completion of each related ride. Revenue generated from Flexdriveand\n Lyft Rentals is recognized evenly over the rental period, which is typically seven days or less. Due to the short-term nature of the Flexdrive, Lyft Rentals, and LightVehicle transactions, we c\nlassify these rentals as operating leases.Insurance Reserves\nWe\n utilize both a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary and third-party insurance, which may include deductibles and self-insured retentions, to insure orreinsure\n costs including auto liability, uninsured and underinsured motorist, auto physical damage, first party injury coverages including personal injury protection understate\n law and general business liabilities up to certain limits. The recorded liabilities reflect the estimated cost for claims incurred but not paid and claims that have beenincurred but not yet\n reported and any estimable administrative run-out expenses related to the processing of these outstanding claim payments. Liabilities are determined ona\n quarterly basis by internal actuaries through an analysis of historical trends, changes in claims experience including consideration of new information and application ofloss\n development factors among other inputs and assumptions. On an annual basis, an independent third-party actuary will evaluate the liabilities for appropriateness withclaims reserve valuations.\nInsurance\n claims may take years to completely settle, and we have limited historical loss experience. Because of the limited operational history, we make certainassumptions\n based  on  currently  available  information  and  industry  statistics,  with  the  loss  development  factors  as  one  of  the  most  significant  assumptions,  and  utilizeactuarial\n models and techniques to estimate the reserves. A number of factors can affect the actual cost of a claim, including the length of time the claim remains open,economic\n and healthcare cost trends and the results of related litigation. Furthermore, claims may emerge in future years for events that occurred in a prior year at a ratethat differs from\n previous actuarial projections. The impact of these factors on ultimate costs for insurance is difficult to estimate and could be material. However, while webelieve\n that the insurance reserve amount is adequate, the ultimate liability may be in excess of, or less than, the amount provided. As a result, the net amounts that willultimately\n be paid to settle the liability and when amounts will be paid may significantly vary from the estimated amounts provided for in the consolidated balance sheets.We\n continue to review our insurance reserve estimates in a regular, ongoing process as historical experience develops, additional claims are reported as settled, and thelegal, regulatory and e\nconomic environment evolves.Stock-Based Compensation\nWe incur stock-based comp\nensation expense primarily from RSUs, performance based stock units (\u201cPSUs\u201d), stock options and stock purchase rights granted underour Employee Stock Purchase Plan (\u201cESPP\u201d).\nWe\n estimate the fair value of stock options granted to employees, directors and consultants and ESPP purchase rights using the Black-Scholes option-pricingmodel.\n The  fair  value  of  stock  options  that  are  expected  to  vest  is  recognized  as  compensation  expense  on  a  straight-line  basis  over  the  requisite  service  period.  Werecognize compensation \nexpense related to the ESPP purchase rights on a straight-line basis over the offering period, which is typically 12 months.The\n fair  value  of  RSUs  and  PSUs  are  estimated  based  on  the  fair  market  value  of  our  common  stock  on  the  date  of  grant,  which  subsequent  to  our  IPO  isdetermined based\n on the closing price of our Class A common stock as reported on the date of grant.

The remaining unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to theseRSUs\n is recorded over their remaining requisite service periods. The compensation expense for RSUs granted after March 28, 2019, which vest upon satisfaction of aservice-based\n condition only, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. As of December 31, 2021, the total unrecognized compensation costrelated to RSUs was $587.5 million, which we expe\nct to recognize over the remaining weighted-average period of approximately 1.7 years.Business Combinations\nWe account for our\n business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires, among other things, allocation of the fair value of purchaseconsideration\n to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. The excess of the fair value ofpurchase\n consideration over the values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. When determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilitiesassumed, we make significant estimates and\n assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to bereasonable,\n but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. During the measurement period, not to exceedone\n year from the date of acquisition, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with a corresponding offset to goodwill if new informationis obtained related to \nfacts and60",

After the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are reflected on the consolidated statements of operations.Acquisition costs, such as legal \nand consulting fees, are expensed as incurred.Goodwill\nGoodwill\n represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination.Intangible\n assets resulting from the acquisition of entities accounted for using the purchase method of accounting are estimated by us based on the fair value of assetsreceived. Intangible \nassets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives which range from two to twelve years.Goodwill\n is not subject to amortization, but is tested for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstancesindicate the carrying\n amount of the goodwill may not be recoverable. As part of the annual goodwill impairment test, we first perform a qualitative assessment to determinewhether\n further impairment testing is necessary. If, as a result of its qualitative assessment, it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than itscarrying amounts, the quant\nitative impairment test will be required. There was no impairment of goodwill recorded for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.Recent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee \nNote 2 to  our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for recently issued accounting pronouncements notyet adopted as of the date o\nf this report.

For example, if in the first quarter of a given year, the cost of claimsgrew by $1 million\n for claims related to the prior fiscal year or earlier, the expense would be recorded for GAAP purposes within the first quarter instead of in the results ofthe\n prior period. We believe these prior period changes to insurance liabilities do not illustrate the current period performance of our ongoing operations since these priorperiod\n changes relate to claims that could potentially date back years. We have limited ability to influence the ultimate development of historical claims. Accordingly,including\n the prior period changes would not illustrate the performance of our ongoing operations or how the business is run or managed by us. For consistency, we do notadjust\n the calculation of Contribution for any prior period based on any positive or adverse development that occurs subsequent to the quarter end.

As of December 31, 2021, insurancereserves\n totaled $1,069 million. Management makes certain assumptions based on currently available information and industry statistics, with the loss development factorsas\n one of the most significant assumptions and utilizes actuarial models and techniques to estimate the reserves. Liabilities are determined on a quarterly basis through ananalysis\n of historical trends, changes in claims experience including consideration of new information and application of loss development factors among other inputs andassumptions.\nThe\n principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of insurance reserves is a critical audit matter are (i) thesignificant\n judgment by management when developing the estimated insurance reserves, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort inperforming\n procedures relating to the valuation of insurance reserves; (ii) the significant auditor effort and judgment in evaluating audit evidence related to the actuarialvaluation methods and the loss d\nevelopment factors; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.Addressing the\n matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financialstatements.\n These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the valuation of insurance reserves, including the controls over the development ofthe actuarial valuation methods\n and the loss development factors. These procedures also included, among others, the involvement of professionals with specialized skill andknowledge\n to  assist  in  developing  an  independent  estimate  of  the  insurance  reserves  for  certain  reserve  segments  and  comparison  of  this  independent  estimate  tomanagement\u2019s\n actuarially  determined  reserves.

(\u201cWoven Planet\u201d)As\n described in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company completed a multi-element transaction with Woven Planet, a subsidiary of ToyotaMotor Corporation,\n for the divestiture of certain assets related to the Company\u2019s self-driving vehicle division, Level 5, as well as commercial agreements for the utilizationof\n Lyft rideshare and fleet data. The Company will receive, in total, approximately $515 million in cash in connection with this transaction, with $165 million paid upfrontand\n $350  million  to  be  paid  over  a  five-year  period.  As  the  transaction  included  multiple  elements,  management  had  to  estimate  how  much  of  the  arrangementconsideration\n was  attributable  to  the  divestiture  of  certain  assets  related  to  the  Level  5  division  and  how  much  was  attributable  to  the  commercial  agreements  for  theutilization\n of Lyft rideshare and fleet data.",

The  Lyft  Platform  provides  a  marketplace  where  drivers  can  be  matched  with  riders  via  the  Lyft  App  where  the  Company  operates  as  atransportation network comp\nany (\u201cTNC\u201d).Transportation\n options through the Company\u2019s platform and mobile-based applications are substantially comprised of its ridesharing marketplace that connectsdrivers and riders in cities across the\n United States and in select cities in Canada, Lyft\u2019s network of Light Vehicles, the Express Drive program, where drivers can enter intoshort-term\n rental  agreements  with  Flexdrive  or  a  third  party  for  vehicles  that  may  be  used  to  provide  ridesharing  services  on  the  Lyft  Platform,  and  Lyft  Rentals,  aconsumer\n offering for users who want to rent a car for a fixed period of time for personal use, and Lyft Driver Centers and Lyft Auto Care, where drivers and riders canrequest auto maintenance an\nd collision repair services offered through the Lyft Platform in certain markets.Basis of Presentation\nThese\n consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP) andinclude the accounts of th\ne Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nUse of Estimates\nThe\n preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts ofassets\n and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expensesduring\n the reporting periods. The Company bases its estimates on various factors and information which may include, but are not limited to, history and prior experience,expected\n future results, new related events and economic conditions, which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that arenot readily apparent from \nother sources. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.85",
        "b4aa0893-46ac-4d1f-8699-775e117cdb71": "Significant items subject to estimates and assumptions include those related to losses resulting from insurance claims, fair value of financial instruments, goodwilland\n identifiable  intangible  assets,  leases,  indirect  tax  obligations,  legal  contingencies,  valuation  allowance  for  deferred  income  taxes,  and  the  valuation  of  stock-basedcompensation.\nBeginning\n in the middle of March 2020, the outbreak of the coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) in the United States, Canada, and globally has impacted the Company\u2019sbusiness.\n The Company continues to be impacted by COVID-19, but the long-term impact will depend largely on future developments, which are highly uncertain andcannot\n be accurately predicted, including the duration of the pandemic, new information about additional variants, the availability and efficacy of vaccine distributions,additional\n or renewed actions by government authorities and private businesses to contain the pandemic or respond to its impact and altered consumer behavior, amongother\n things. The Company has adopted a number of measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic including, but not limited to, establishing new health and safetyrequirements\n for ridesharing and updating workplace policies. The Company also made adjustments to its expenses and cash flow to correlate with declines in revenuesincluding\n headcount reductions in 2020. Refer to Note 17 \u201cRestructuring\u201d to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the 2020 restructuring events. The\n Company  cannot  be  certain  that  these  actions  will  mitigate  the  negative  effects  of  the  pandemic  on  Lyft's  business.  As  of  the  date  of  issuance  of  the  financialstatements,\n the Company is not aware of any material event or circumstance that would require it to update its estimates, judgments or revise the carrying value of theCompany's\n assets or liabilities, including the recording of any credit losses. These estimates may change, as new events occur and additional information is obtained, andcould\n lead to impairment of long lived assets or goodwill, or credit losses associated with investments or other assets, and the impact of such changes on estimates will berecognized\n on the consolidated  financial  statements  as soon as they become known. Actual  results could differ  from those estimates  and any such differences  may bematerial to the Company'\ns financial statements.Segment Information\nOperating\n segments  are  defined  as  components  of  an  entity  for  which  separate  financial  information  is  available  and  that  is  regularly  reviewed  by  the  ChiefOperating\n Decision  Maker  (\u201cCODM\u201d)  in  deciding  how  to  allocate  resources  to  an  individual  segment  and  in  assessing  performance.  The  Company\u2019s  Chief  ExecutiveOfficer\n is  the Company\u2019s  CODM. The  CODM reviews  financial  information  presented  on  a  consolidated  basis  for  purposes  of  making  operating  decisions,  allocatingresources,\n and evaluating financial performance. As such, the Company has determined that it operates as one operating segment. During the years ended December 31,2021,\n 2020 and 2019, the Company did not generate material international revenues and as of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company did not have materialassets located outside of \nthe United States.Revenue Recognition\nThe\n Company generates its revenue from its multimodal transportation networks that offer access to a variety of transportation options through the Lyft Platformand\n mobile-based applications. Substantially all of the Company\u2019s revenue is generated from its ridesharing marketplace that connects drivers and riders and is recognizedin\n accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606 (\u201cASC 606\u201d). In addition, the Company generates revenue in accordance with ASC 606 from licensingand\n data access, primarily with third-party autonomous vehicle companies. The Company also generates rental revenue from Flexdrive, its network of Light Vehicles andLyft Rentals, which is recogniz\ned in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 842 (\u201cASC 842\u201d).The table below presents the Comp\nany's revenues as included on the consolidated statements of operations (in thousands):Year Ended December 31,\n2021\n2020 2019 Revenue from contracts with \ncustomers (ASC 606)$ 2,957,979 $ 2,208,656 $ 3,465,473 Rental revenue (ASC 842)\n250,344 156,025 150,487 Total revenue\n$ 3,208,323 $ 2,364,681 $ 3,615,960 86",

The Company generates revenue from service fees and commissions(collectively, \u201cfees\u201d) paid by\n drivers for use of the Lyft Platform and related activities to connect drivers with riders to facilitate and successfully complete rides via the LyftApp\n where  the  Company  operates  as  a  TNC.  The  Company  recognizes  revenue  upon  completion  of  each  ride.  Drivers  enter  into  terms  of  service  (\u201cToS\u201d)  with  theCompany\n in order to use the Lyft Driver App. Under the ToS, drivers agree that the Company retains the applicable fee as consideration for their use of the Lyft Platformand related\n activities from the fare and related charges it collects from riders on behalf of drivers. The Company is acting as an agent in facilitating the ability of a driver toprovide a\n transportation service to a rider. The Company reports revenue on a net basis, reflecting the fee owed to the Company from a driver as revenue, and not the grossamount collected from the rider.\nAs\n the Company\u2019s customary business practice, a contract exists between the driver and the Company when the driver\u2019s ability to cancel the ride lapses, whichtypically\n is upon pickup of the rider. The Company\u2019s single performance obligation in the transaction is to connect drivers with riders to facilitate the completion of asuccessful\n transportation service for riders. The Company recognizes revenue upon completion of a ride as its performance obligation is satisfied upon the completion ofthe\n ride. The Company collects the fare and related charges from riders on behalf of drivers using the rider\u2019s pre-authorized credit card or other payment mechanism andretains its fees befo\nre making the remaining disbursement to drivers; thus the driver\u2019s ability and intent to pay is not subject to significant judgment.The\n Company recognizes revenue from subscription fees paid to access transportation options through the Lyft Platform and mobile-based applications over theapplicable\n subscription period in accordance with ASC 606. The Company also recognizes revenue from auto maintenance and collision repair services in accordance withASC 606.\nThe\n Company generates revenue from licensing and data access agreements. The Company is primarily responsible for fulfilling its promise to provide ridesharedata\n and  access  to  Flexdrive  vehicles  and  bears  the  fulfillment  risk,  and  the  responsibility  of  providing  the  data,  over  the  license  period.  The  Company  is  acting  as  aprincipal\n in delivering the data and access licenses and presents revenue on a gross basis. Consideration allocated to each performance obligation, the data delivery andvehicle access, is determined by assigning the relative fair value to each of the performance obligation\ns. Revenue is recorded upon delivery of the rideshare data and ratablyover the quarter for a\nccess to fleet vehicles as the Company\u2019s respective performance obligation is satisfied upon the delivery of each.Rental Revenue (ASC 842)\nThe\n Company generates rental revenues primarily from Flexdrive, its network of Light Vehicles, and Lyft Rentals. Rental revenues are recognized for rental andrental related a\nctivities where an identified asset is transferred to the customer and the customer has the ability to control that asset in accordance with ASC 842.The\n Company operates a fleet of rental vehicles through Flexdrive comprised of both owned vehicles and vehicles leased from third-party leasing companies. TheCompany\n either leases or subleases vehicles to drivers and Lyft Rentals renters, and as a result, the Company considers itself to be the accounting lessor or sublessor, asapplicable,\n in these arrangements in accordance with ASC 842. Fleet operating costs include monthly fixed lease payments and other vehicle operating or ownership costs,as\n applicable. For vehicles that are subleased, sublease income and head lease expense for these transactions are recognized on a gross basis on the consolidated financialstatements. Drivers who rent v\nehicles are charged rental fees, which the Company collects from the driver by deducting such amounts from the driver\u2019s earnings on the LyftPlatform.\nDue\n to the short-term nature of the Flexdrive, Lyft Rentals, and Light Vehicle transactions, the Company classifies these rentals as operating leases. Revenuegenerated\n from single-use ride fees paid by Light Vehicle riders is recognized upon completion of each related ride.

The allowance for credit losses reflects the Company\u2019s current estimate of expected credit losses inherent in the enterprise andtrade\n receivables  balance.  In  determining  the  expected  credit  losses,  the  Company  considers  its  historical  loss  experience,  the  aging  of  its  receivable  balance,  currenteconomic and\n business conditions, and anticipated future economic events that may impact collectability. The Company reviews its allowance for credit losses periodicallyand as needed, and amounts are wr\nitten off when determined to be uncollectible.The\n Company\u2019s receivable balance, which consists primarily of amounts due from Enterprise Users, was $196.2 million, $104.7 million and $120.0 million as ofDecember\n 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Company's allowance for credit losses was $9.3 million, $15.2 million and $6.2 million as of December 31, 2021,2020\n and 2019, respectively.  The write-offs were immaterial  for the year ended December 31, 2021. The change in the allowance  for credit losses for the year endedDecember\n 31, 2021 was related to $4.5 million of reductions for provision for expected credit losses and $1.4 million of write-offs.

The change inthe\n allowance for credit losses for the year ended December 31, 2019 was related to $5.1 million of additions for provision for expected credit losses and $1.5 million ofwrite-offs.\nIncentive Programs\nThe\n Company offers incentives to attract drivers, riders, Light Vehicle riders and Lyft Rentals renters to use the Lyft Platform. Drivers generally receive cashincentives\n while riders,  Light Vehicle  riders and Lyft Rentals  renters  generally  receive  free  or discounted  rides  under such incentive  programs.  Incentives  provided  todrivers,\n Light Vehicle riders and Lyft Rental renters, the customers of the Company, are accounted for as a reduction of the transaction price. As the riders are not theCompany\u2019s customers, incentiv\nes provided to riders are generally recognized as sales and marketing expense except for certain pricing programs described below.Driver Incentives\nThe\n Company  offers  various  incentive  programs  to  drivers,  including  minimum  guaranteed  payments,  volume-based  discounts  and  performance-based  bonuspayments.\n These  driver  incentives  are  similar  to  retrospective  volume-based  rebates  and  represent  variable  consideration  that  is  typically  settled  within  a  week.  TheCompany\n reduces the transaction price by the estimated amount of the incentives expected to be paid upon completion of the performance criteria by applying the mostlikely\n outcome method. Therefore, such driver incentives are recorded as a reduction to revenue. Driver incentives are recorded as a reduction to revenue if the Companydoes\n not receive a distinct good or service in exchange for the payment or cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of the good or service received. Driver incentives forreferring\n new drivers or riders are accounted for as sales and marketing expense. The amount recorded as an expense is the lesser of the amount of the payment or theestablished fair value of t\nhe benefit received. The fair value of the benefit is established using amounts paid to third parties for similar services.Rideshare Rider Incentives\nThe\n Company has several rideshare rider incentive programs, which are offered to encourage rider activity on the Lyft Platform. Generally, the rider incentiveprograms are as follows:\n(i)\nMarket-wide marketing promotions.  Market-wide  promotions reduce the fare charged by drivers to riders for all or substantially all rides in a specific market.This\n type of incentive effectively reduces the overall pricing of the service provided by drivers for that specific market and the gross fare charged by thedriver\n to the rider, and thereby results in a lower fee earned by the Company. Accordingly, the Company records this type of incentive as a reduction torevenue at the date i\nt records the corresponding revenue transaction.(ii)\nTargeted marketing promotions.  Targeted  marketing promotions are used to promote the use of the Lyft Platform to a targeted group of riders. An example isa\n promotion where the Company offers a number of discounted rides (capped at a given number of rides) which are valid only during a limited period of timeto\n a targeted group of riders.",

The Company believes that the incentives that provide consideration to riders to be applied to a limited number of rides aresimilar\n to  marketing  coupons.  These  incentives  differ  from  the  market-wide  marketing  promotions  because  they  do  not  reduce  the  overall  pricing  of  theservice\n provided  by  drivers  for  a  specific  market.  During  the  promotion  period,  riders  not  utilizing  an  incentive  would  be  charged  the  full  fare.  Theseincentives\n represent marketing costs. When a rider redeems the incentive, the Company recognizes revenue equal to the transaction price and the cost of theincentive is recorded \nas sales and marketing expense.(iii)\nRider  referral programs. Under  the rider referral program, the referring rider (the referrer) earns referral coupons when a new rider (the referee) completestheir\n first ride on the Lyft Platform. The Company records the incentive as a liability at the time the incentive is earned by the referrer with the correspondingcharge\n recorded to sales and marketing  expense. Referral  coupons typically  expire within one year. The Company estimates breakage  using its historicalexperience.

The  entiredifference between the amortized cost basis and the fair value of the Company\u2019s available-for-sale debt securities is recognized on the cons\nolidated statements of operationsas\n an impairment if, (i) the fair value of the security is below its amortized cost and (ii) the Company intends to sell or is more likely than not required to sell the securitybefore\n recovery of its amortized cost basis. If neither criterion is met, the Company evaluates whether the decline in fair value is due to credit losses or other factors. Inmaking\n this assessment, the Company considers the extent to which the security\u2019s fair value is less than amortized cost, changes to the rating of the security by third-partyrating\n agencies,  and  adverse  conditions  specific  to  the  security,  among  other  factors.  If  the  Company's  assessment  indicates  that  a  credit  loss  exists,  the  credit  loss  ismeasured\n based on  the  Company's best  estimate  of  the cash  flows  expected  to  be  collected.

As such, fair value may be based on assumptions that market participants woulduse\n in pricing an asset or liability. The authoritative guidance on fair value measurements establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value on either a recurringor\n nonrecurring basis, whereby inputs used in valuation techniques, are assigned a hierarchical level. The following are the hierarchical levels of inputs to measure fairvalue:\nLevel 1\nObservable inputs t hat reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.Level 2\nInputs  reflect quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; inputsother\n than quoted prices that are observable for the assets or liabilities; or inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data bycorrelation or other means.\nLevel\n 3Unobservable  inputs  reflecting  our  own  assumptions  incorporated  in  valuation  techniques  used  to  determine  fair  value.

        "de535769-0955-445f-8d1d-08f1294b4d5f": "Leases that do not meet any of the above criteria are accounted for as operating leases.Lessor\nThe\n Company's lease arrangements include vehicle rentals to drivers or renters under the Flexdrive and Lyft Rentals programs and Light Vehicle rentals to single-use\n riders. Due to the short-term nature of these arrangements, the Company classifies these leases as operating leases. The Company does not separate lease and non-leasecomponents,\n such as insurance or roadside assistance provided to the lessee, in its lessor lease arrangements. Lease payments are primarily fixed and are recognized asrevenue in the\n period over which the lease arrangement occurs. Taxes or other fees assessed by governmental authorities that are both imposed on and concurrent with eachlease\n revenue-producing transaction and collected by the Company from the lessee are excluded from the consideration in its lease arrangements. The Company mitigatesresidual\n value risk of its leased assets by performing regular maintenance and repairs, as necessary, and through periodic reviews of asset depreciation rates based on theCompany's ongoing assessment of present \nand estimated future market conditions.Lessee\nThe\n Company's leases include real estate property to support its operations and Flexdrive vehicles that may be used by drivers to provide ridesharing services onthe\n Lyft Platform or renters for personal reasons through Lyft Rentals. For leases with a term greater than 12 months, the Company records the related right-of-use assetand\n lease liability at the present value of lease payments over the term. The lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certainthat\n the Company will exercise such options. The Company does not separate lease and non-lease components of contracts for real estate property leases, but has elected todo\n so for vehicle leases when non-lease components exist in these arrangements. For certain leases, the Company also applies a portfolio approach to account for right-of-use assets and lease lia\nbilities that are similar in nature and have nearly identical contract provisions.The\n Company\u2019s leases do not provide a readily determinable implicit rate. Therefore, the Company estimates its incremental borrowing rate to discount the leasepayments\n based on information available at lease commencement. The Company determines its incremental borrowing rate based on the rate of interest that the Companywould have to pay to borrow on a collat\neralized basis over a similar term for an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment.Lease payments may be fixed or variable; however, only fixed payments are included in the Compan\ny\u2019s lease liability calculation. Operating leases are included inoperating\n lease right-of-use assets, operating lease liabilities \u2014 current and operating lease liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Lease costs for the Company'soperating leases\n are recognized on a straight-line basis primarily within operating expenses over the lease term. Finance leases are included in property and equipment, net,accrued and other current lia\nbilities, and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Finance lease assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of theestimated useful\n lives of the assets or the lease term in cost of revenue on the consolidated statements of operations. The interest component of finance leases is included incost of\n revenue on the consolidated statements of operations and recognized using the effective interest method over the lease term. Variable lease payments are recognizedprimarily in operat\ning expenses in the period in which the obligation for those payments are incurred.Property and Equipment\nProperty\n and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using a straight-line method over the estimated useful life ofthe\n related  asset,  which  is  generally  between two  and  seven  years.  Depreciation  for  property  and  equipment  commences  once  they  are  ready  for  our  intended  use.Maintenance\n and repairs are charged to expense as incurred, and improvements and betterments are capitalized. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the costand\n accumulated depreciation are removed from the consolidated balance sheet and any resulting gain or loss is reflected on the consolidated statement of operations in theperiod\n realized. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the term of the lease, or the useful life of the assets.

As part of the annual goodwill impairment test, the Company first performs a qualitativeassessment\n to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary.

Such events and changes  may include:  significant  changes in performancerelative\n to expected operating results, changes in asset use, negative industry or economic trends, and changes in the Company\u2019s business strategy. The Company measuresrecoverability\n of these assets by comparing the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows that the assets or the asset group are expected to generate.

The Company capitalizes development costs related to the LyftPlatform\n and related support systems once the preliminary project stage is complete and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used toperform\n the function intended. The Company capitalized $16.2 million and $12.8 million of software development costs during the year ended December 31, 2021 and2020, respectively.

The recorded liabilities reflect the estimated cost for claims incurred but not paid and claims that havebeen\n incurred  but  not  yet  reported  and  any  estimable  administrative  run-out  expenses  related  to  the  processing  of  these  outstanding  claim  payments.  Liabilities  aredetermined\n on a quarterly basis by internal actuaries through an analysis of historical trends, changes in claims experience including consideration of new information andapplication\n of loss development factors among other inputs and assumptions. On an annual basis or more frequently as determined by management, an independent third-party actuary will evaluate t\nhe liabilities for appropriateness with claims reserve valuations.Insurance\n claims  may take years to completely settle,  and the Company has limited  historical loss experience. Because of the limited operational  history, theCompany\n makes  certain  assumptions  based  on  currently  available  information  and  industry  statistics,  with  the  loss  development  factors  as  one  of  the  most  significantassumptions, and utilizes actuarial\n models and techniques to estimate the reserves. A number of factors can affect the actual cost of a claim, including the length of time theclaim\n remains open, economic and healthcare cost trends and the results of related litigation. Furthermore, claims may emerge in future years for events that occurred in aprior\n year at a rate that differs from previous actuarial projections. The impact of these factors on ultimate costs for insurance is difficult to estimate and could be material.However,\n while the Company believes that the insurance reserve amount is adequate, the ultimate liability may be in excess of, or less than, the amount provided. As aresult,\n the net amounts that will ultimately be paid to settle the liability and when amounts will be paid may significantly vary from the estimated amounts provided for onthe\n consolidated balance sheets. The Company continues to review its insurance estimates in a regular, ongoing process as historical loss experience develops, additionalclaims are report\ned and settled, and the legal, regulatory and economic environment evolves.Net Loss Per Share\nThe Company follows the two-class method when computing net\n loss per common share when shares are issued that meet the definition of participating securities.The\n two-class method determines net loss per common share for each class of common stock and participating securities according to dividends declared or accumulatedand\n participation rights in undistributed earnings.

In addition, the Company has been, and is currently, named as a defendant in a number of litigationmatters related \nto accidents or other trust and safety incidents involving drivers or riders using the Lyft Platform.The outcomes\n of the Company\u2019s legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. For some matters for which a material lossis\n reasonably  possible,  an estimate  of  the amount  of  loss or  range  of  losses  is not  possible  nor  is  the Company  able  to  estimate  the loss  or  range  of  losses that  couldpotentially\n result from the application of nonmonetary remedies. Until the final resolution of legal matters, there may be an exposure to a material loss in excess of theamount recorded.\nIndependent Contractor Classificat\nion MattersWith\n regard to independent contractor classification of drivers on the Lyft Platform, the Company is regularly subject to claims, lawsuits, arbitration proceedings,administrative actions, government investigation\ns and other legal and regulatory proceedings at the federal, state and municipal levels challenging the classification of thesedrivers\n as independent contractors, and claims that, by the alleged misclassification, the Company has violated various labor and other laws that would apply to driveremployees.\n Laws  and  regulations  that  govern  the  status  and  classification  of  independent  contractors  are  subject  to  change  and  divergent  interpretations  by  variousauthorities, which can cr\neate uncertainty and unpredictability for the Company.For\n example,  Assembly  Bill  5  (as  codified  in  part  at  Cal.

The passage of this bill led to additional challenges tothe\n independent contractor classification of drivers using the Lyft Platform. For example, on May 5, 2020, the California Attorney General and the City Attorneys of LosAngeles,\n San  Diego  and  San  Francisco  filed  a  lawsuit  against  the  Company  and  Uber  for  allegedly  misclassifying  drivers  on  the  companies\u2019  respective  platforms  asindependent\n contractors  in  violation  of  Assembly  Bill  5  and  California\u2019s  Unfair  Competition  Law,  and  on  August  5,  2020,  the  California  Labor  Commissioner  filedlawsuits\n against the Company and Uber for allegedly misclassifying drivers on the companies\u2019 respective platforms as independent contractors, seeking injunctive reliefand\n material damages and penalties. On August 10, 2020, the court granted a motion for a preliminary injunction, forcing the Company and Uber to reclassify drivers inCalifornia\n as employees until the end of the lawsuit. Subsequently, voters in California approved Proposition 22, a state ballot initiative that provided a framework fordrivers\n utilizing platforms like Lyft to maintain their status as independent contractors under California law. Proposition 22 went into effect on December 16, 2020. OnApril\n 20, 2021, the court granted the parties\u2019 joint request to dissolve the preliminary injunction in light of the passage of Proposition 22. On May 3, 2021, the CaliforniaLabor\n Commissioner filed a petition to coordinate its lawsuit with the Attorney General lawsuit and three other cases against the Company and Uber. The coordinationpetition\n was granted and the coordinated cases have been assigned to a judge in San Francisco Superior Court. On January 12, 2021, a separate lawsuit was filed in theCalifornia\n Supreme Court against the State of California alleging that Proposition 22 is unconstitutional under the California Constitution. The California Supreme Courtdenied\n review on February 3, 2021. Plaintiffs then filed a similar lawsuit in Alameda County Superior Court on February 12, 2021. Protect App-Based Drivers & Services(PADS) -- the coalition that established and operated the official ballot measure committee that succes\nsfully advocated for the passage of Proposition 22 -- intervened in theAlameda\n lawsuit. On August 20, 2021, after a merits hearing, the Alameda Superior Court issued an order finding that Proposition 22 is unenforceable. Both the CaliforniaAttorney General and\n PADS have filed appeals to the California Court of Appeal. Briefing is currently underway. Separately, on July 14, 2020, the Massachusetts AttorneyGeneral filed a lawsuit \nagainst the Company and Uber for allegedly misclassifying drivers as independent contractors under Massachusetts law, and seeking declaratory andinjunctive relief.\n The Company and Uber filed motions to dismiss, which were denied by the court in March 2021.

Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefitsof controls must be consider\ned relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance thatall control issues and inst\nances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and thatbreakdowns can occur because\n of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or morepeople or by management override of the\n controls. The design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events,and\n there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequatebecause\n of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Due to inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system,misstatements due to e\nrror or fraud may occur and not be detected.Item 9B. Other Information.\nNone.\nItem 9C.

Besides waiving rights and releasing claims encompassed by the General Release in Section 7(a) above, Employee promises not to bring a lawsuit or arbitration against the Company alleging any claim or violation of rights covered by that General Release.

Details regarding exceptions to this covenant and damages Employee must pay for violating it are\ncontained in Sections 7(d) and 18 below.\n(c) \nWaiver of Unknown Claims. This general and complete release covers both claims that Employee knows about and those that Employee may not know about and that exist in Employee\u2019s favor at the time of executing this Agreement.

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Employee is not waiving, releasing or giving up any claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits or unemployment benefits to which the Employee has an unwaivable right, vested pension or savings plan\nbenefits, claims to enforce this Agreement, claims under sections 2800 to 2810 of the California Labor Code, and claims under other state statutes\nthat may not be waived as a matter of law in an agreement of this type. Employee acknowledges, however, that Employee has no work-related injury\nor illness at the time of signing this Agreement for which Employee has not already filed a workers compensation claim. Nothing in any part of this\nAgreement limits or waives Employee\u2019s right to file a charge with an administrative agency, provide testimony or other information to an agency, or\ntake part in any agency investigation; however, Employee is waiving Employee\u2019s right to recover any monetary or other relief in connection with\nsuch an investigation or charge filed by Employee or by any other individual, or a charge filed by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission\nor any other federal, state or local agency.

Employee acknowledges that the consideration Employee is receiving under this Agreement, including but not limited to the Severance Pay, constitutes a benefit to which Employee is not otherwise entitled under any policy, statute, law, or any\nagreement between the Company and Employee, and is adequate consideration for Employee\u2019s covenants and obligations under this Agreement,\nincluding the General Release.\n9.\nNo Pending Litigation . Employee hereby represents that there is no pending action filed (either by Employee or on Employee\u2019s behalf) in any court of law, in arbitration, or in any other legal forum against the Company or any of the Released Parties or any other person, entity\nor corporation in connection with Employee\u2019s employment with the Company.\n10.\nProperty of Employer . Employee represents that Employee has returned to the Company all property of the Company, including but not limited to any keys, access cards, passwords, or equipment belonging to the Company and documents, records, and data in paper or electronic\nformat, as well as all copies of such materials. Employee also agrees to make a good-faith reasonable effort to delete all electronic copies of any such\nmaterials in Employee\u2019s possession (including on any personal device) following return of such electronic documents to the Company.

In the event that Employee fails to\nreturn all such property, the Company\u2019s obligation under this Agreement shall cease, including the payment obligations described above.\n11.\nReference Inquiries . Employee should instruct any prospective employers to direct their reference inquiries to the Human Resources Department. In the event the Human Resources Department receives any inquiries from prospective employers, the Human Resources\nDepartment will respond by advising that the Company\u2019s policy is to provide information only as to service dates and positions held and by\nproviding such information.\n12.\nConfidentiality Matters . (a) \nConfidential or Proprietary Information. Employee acknowledges that, by reason of Employee\u2019s employment, Employee had access to confidential, proprietary, and trade secret information (including customer lists not known to the public) of the Company, and that Employee\nunderstands Employee\u2019s obligations under the law and agrees not to disclose or divulge to any third party or otherwise use or allow to be used in any\nmanner (whether for Employee\u2019s benefit, for the benefit of another individual or entity, or otherwise) any confidential, trade secret or proprietary\ninformation concerning the operations or business of the Company at any time following the Separation Date. These obligations shall not apply to\ninformation that (i) is now a part of public knowledge or literature or is generally known in the industry; or (ii) hereafter becomes a part of the public\nknowledge or generally known in the industry from a source other than Employee, either directly or indirectly. Moreover, nothing in this Agreement\nshall limit Employee\u2019s ability to report possible violations of law in confidence to the appropriate government agency or entity or make other\ndisclosures protected under the whistleblower provisions of applicable federal or state law or regulation. Pursuant to the Defend Trade Secrets Act of\n2016, Employee will not face civil or criminal liability for disclosing a trade secret: (1) to a government official or an attorney, if the disclosure is\nmade in confidence and for the sole purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; or (2) in a document filed in a lawsuit or other\nproceeding, provided the document is filed under seal. \nIn addition, if Employee files a lawsuit for retaliation by the Company for reporting a suspected violation of law, Employee may disclose a trade secret to Employee\u2019s attorney and use the trade secret information in the court proceeding,\nprovided the document containing the trade secret is filed under seal and Employee does not otherwise disclose the trade secret except pursuant to\ncourt order. \nThe confidentiality and non-disclosure obligations in this paragraph are in addition to, and not in lieu of, Employee\u2019s obligations under the Employee Invention Assignment and Confidentiality Agreement that Employee signed on October 6, 2014 (the \u201cConfidentiality Agreement\u201d),\nand Employee will remain bound by the obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement, at all times in the future, even after the Separation Date.\n(b) \nConfidentiality of Agreement. Employee acknowledges and agrees that the terms of this Agreement, to the extent they are not publiclydisclosed by the Company are \nABSOLUTELY CONFIDENTIAL . To the fullest extent permitted by law, the terms of this Agreement, unless previously publicly disclosed by the Company \nshall not, without the Company\u2019s prior written consent, be disclosed 4",

Except as provided in thisparagraph, Employee shall not: (a) communicate or disclose in any way the amount of the Severance Pay or benefits made by the Company; or\n(b) give any indication of the amount of the Severance Pay. \nEmployee may communicate the terms and conditions of this Agreement (1) to Employee\u2019s spouse/domestic partner; or (2) to Employee\u2019s attorney and those rendering financial or legal advice and having a bona fide need to\nknow such terms and conditions; provided, however, Employee shall advise any such individuals beforehand of the existence of Employee\u2019s\nconfidentiality obligations under this Agreement and their corresponding obligations to maintain the confidentiality of this Agreement. A breach of\nthese obligations by Employee\u2019s spouse/domestic partner, attorney, advisor, or agents will be deemed a breach of this Agreement by Employee.\nMoreover, nothing in this Agreement shall preclude Employee from disclosing the terms and conditions of this Agreement to government agencies\nfor tax purposes (i.e., the IRS and Franchise Tax Board); or if required by a valid court order, subpoena, or regulatory request or other compulsory\nprocess or law; provided, however, that Employee shall advise such agency or court of the confidential nature of this Agreement and shall exercise\nreasonable efforts to obtain reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to the subject matter disclosed.

Employee agrees that if Employee, Employee\u2019s attorney, or Employee\u2019saccountant, financial advisor or spouse/domestic partner breaches the promise to maintain the confidentiality of this Agreement and the Severance\nPay, then the resulting damage to the Company would be impracticable or extremely difficult to determine because of the uncertain effect of the\ndisclosure of such information on the Company\u2019s present and future business prospects. Because of the difficulty of determining the damages\nresulting from any such breach of the confidentiality provisions of this Agreement, the parties agree that in the event of such a breach by Employee\neither directly by Employee or indirectly through Employee\u2019s spouse, attorney or agents, Employee shall be obligated to re-pay to the Company the\nsum of five thousand dollars ($5,000) as liquidated damages for each occurrence, which amount Employee agrees is reasonable.

Employee\u2019s cooperation in\nconnection with such claims, actions, or investigations will include, but not be limited to, being available to meet with the Company\u2019s counsel to\nprepare for discovery or any legal proceeding, executing documents, and providing truthful testimony as a witness on behalf of the Company at\nmutually convenient times. The Company will reimburse Employee for all reasonable, pre-approved out-of-pocket costs and expenses (but not\nincluding attorneys\u2019 fees) that Employee incurs in connection with obligations under this paragraph.\n14.\nNon-Disparagement . The Parties agree that they will not disparage, discredit or otherwise defame one another, including the Company or its officers, directors and employees, in any form, manner, or media, including but not limited to oral or written statements, social\nmedia, or any other form of electronic communication, or otherwise take any action which could reasonably be expected to adversely affect the\npersonal or business reputation of the Parties.
